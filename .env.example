# .env - Configuration file for local development
# Copy this file to '.env' in your backend directory to activate it.

# Environment mode (options: development, production, testing)
# This is automatically detected as 'production' on Render.
ENVIRONMENT=development

# For local development with SQLite (default setup):
# The database file 'trademarks.db' will be created inside the backend project folder.
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./trademarks.db"

# To use a local PostgreSQL database instead, comment out the SQLite line above
# and uncomment the line below, replacing the credentials with your own.
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/trademark_db"

# In production (on Render.com), the following variables are set automatically
# by the platform and should NOT be set in the .env file for deployment:
# RENDER=true
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (provided by the Render PostgreSQL service)
